 . Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app should validate the the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
 . Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer token and user information to our database
